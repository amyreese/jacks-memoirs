PROLOGUE







												A few years ago, through a cousin of Norma's, I became interested in genealogy.  In my search for ancestors, I found that there was little to no recorded information regarding my paternal or maternal grandparents, other than what I could remember hearing in family discussions.  I found that I had to do a lot of questioning regarding any ancestors past my parents.  Many times, I am sorry to say, my father seemingly didn't want to discuss his family roots, or much about his father, mother, or his grandparents.  It was not until after the death of my father that I found in his personal effects some records of his father and grandfather.  I found the discharge papers of his paternal grandfather from his service in the US Army during the Civil War. Also through search of census records, I found that my paternal grandparents, according to the 1910 census had quite a house full of people. In addition to my grandparents, my great grandmother, my father and his siblings, there were also my grandmother's step sister, Caroline Wilke, and two people named Westgerdes, John and his daughter Adalaid. I am familiar with the house, and I don't know how all those people fit into the house. So searching through census records can reveal a lot of information.   																			I determined that each of us should permanently record a memoir or autobiography of our life.  In this way future generations of our family will know something about each of us (good or bad), and in this way we will be able to record a part of our personal history.  The following is my attempt to practice what I preach.  I hope that this memoir will be kept for future generations.
